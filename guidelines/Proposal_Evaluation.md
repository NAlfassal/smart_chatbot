# Capstone Proposal Evaluation Rubric

## **1. Problem & Solution Alignment**

| Criteria | Expectations |
| --- | --- |
| **Problem Statement** | Clearly identifies a specific user (e.g., "HR Managers") and a specific pain point (e.g., "Manual resume screening"). |
| **Solution Logic** | The proposed Agent/RAG solution directly addresses the pain point. It is not just "tech for tech's sake." |

## **2. Data Strategy**

| Criteria | Expectations |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Availability** | Dataset is identified and accessible **now**. (No "we will look for data later"). |
| **Suitability** | **2 Members:** Single source type (e.g., PDF contracts) is fine.<br> <br>**3-4 Members:** Complex/Diverse data is preferred (e.g., PDFs + Excel sheets + Web Scrape). |

## **3. Technical Feasibility & Architecture**

| Criteria | Expectations |
| --- | --- |
| **Stack Choice** | Standard stack selected (e.g., Python, LangChain, ChromaDB, Streamlit). No obscure tools without justification. |
| **Role Definition** | **2 Members:** General division (e.g., "Backend/Frontend") is acceptable.<br/> <br>**3-4 Members:** **Strict Requirement.** Must list specific owners for Data, AI/Prompts, Frontend, and Ops. |

## **4. Scope & Complexity Qualifier**

| Criteria | Expectations |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature Set** | **2 Members:** MVP must include Ingestion, Vector Search, and Chat UI.<br/> <br/>**3-4 Members:** **Must include 2 Advanced Features** (Hybrid Search, Multi-modality, Eval Pipeline, or Cloud Deployment). |
| **Ambition** | Scope is realistic for a 3-week timeline (Week 6-8). Not too simple (a "Hello World" app) nor impossible (building AGI). |

## **Refusal Triggers (Automatic Resubmission)**

1. **No Dataset:** "We will find a dataset later"  **Immediate Reject**.
2. **Scope Creep:** "We will build a mobile app, a web app, and train our own LLM from scratch"  **Reject** (Too broad).
3. **Role Ambiguity (Large Teams):** A team of 4 listing "We will all work on everything"  **Reject**.

## How to Handle Group Submissions?

**Google Classroom** does not have native "Team Submissions." so we need to handle it manually: "One person submits for the team. The others must click 'Mark as Done' but attach nothing."
